# Adhoc - Mad Libs Story Generator

A creative Mad Libs website that generates hilarious stories by having users fill in words for different parts of speech. This repository contains two different implementations showcasing different approaches to building interactive web applications.

## üé≠ What is Adhoc?

Adhoc is a Mad Libs game where users:
1. Choose from various story themes
2. Fill in words for different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.)
3. See their words inserted into a pre-written story template
4. Enjoy the hilarious results!

## üõ† Development Philosophy

### Version 1 Approach
- **Component Architecture**: Leverages React's component system for reusable UI elements
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures compile-time error checking
- **Build Optimization**: Next.js handles bundling, minification, and optimization
- **Modern Tooling**: Built-in development server, hot reloading, and deployment optimization

### Version 2 Approach  
- **Web Standards First**: Uses only native browser APIs and standards
- **Zero Dependencies**: No build tools, frameworks, or external libraries required
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works on any modern browser without compilation
- **Performance Focus**: Minimal payload and instant loading
- **Accessibility**: Built with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## üìä Performance Metrics

### v1 (Next.js)
- **First Load JS**: 71KB shared + page-specific bundles
- **Bundle Analysis**: Framework code, React runtime, page components
- **Build Process**: Compilation, bundling, optimization required
- **Deployment**: Static export or server-side rendering

### v2 (Vanilla)
- **Total Size**: ~15KB (HTML + CSS + JS combined)
- **No Build Process**: Ready to deploy as-is
- **Cache Strategy**: Individual file caching
- **Loading**: Instant on modern browsers

## üé® Design Principles

Both versions follow these design principles:
- **Playful & Fun**: Bright colors, animations, and engaging interactions
- **User-Friendly**: Clear navigation and progress indicators
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation and semantic HTML
- **Fast**: Optimized for quick loading and smooth interactions

## üîÑ Migration Story

This project demonstrates the evolution from a modern framework-based approach (v1) to a vanilla web standards approach (v2). The migration showcases:

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated build tools and dependencies
2. **Improved Performance**: Faster loading with smaller bundle size
3. **Enhanced Features**: Added local storage, sharing, and sound effects
4. **Better Offline Experience**: Works without internet after initial load
5. **Simplified Deployment**: No build process required

## üìù Adding New Stories

### For v1 (Next.js):
Add stories in the `v1/adhocs/` directory with this structure:
```json
{
  "title": "Story Title",
  "blanks": [
    { "id": 0, "blankType": "adjective" },
    { "id": 1, "blankType": "noun" },
    { "id": 2, "blankType": "verb" }
  ],
  "story": "This is a story of the very {0} {1} that could {2}."
}
```

### For v2 (Vanilla):
Add stories in the `v2/data/` directory with this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "story-id",
  "title": "Story Title",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "icon": "üé≠",
  "template": "Story with {placeholder1} and {placeholder2}...",
  "blanks": [
    {"id": "placeholder1", "type": "noun", "label": "Person's name"},
    {"id": "placeholder2", "type": "adjective", "label": "Adjective"}
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment
